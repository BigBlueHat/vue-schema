# vue-schema

Early attempt at a [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/)-based form builder that
leverages [JSONSchema](http://json-schema.org/) for schemas.

It's early yet. Help is appreciated!

# Need a Form-builder now?

Checkout [re:form.ed](https://bigbluehat.github.io/reformed/) for
general purpose JSON editing. `vue-schema` is intended to be the
reformation of re:form.ed.

Checkout [json-editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) for
a (far) more production ready JSON Schema-based form builder.
